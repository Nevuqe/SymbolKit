# SymbolKit CSS

Import the CSS File:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nevuqe/SymbolKit/main/css/symbolkit.css">
```

Here is an example in HTML:

```html
<i class="symbolkit-hand-brake"></i>
```
The class must always be "symbolkit-" and then the name of the icon.

The icons are `display: inline-block` and default to the current font size. You can control this
by adjusting the `::before` styles of the element (which is where the icons are added as a mask).
